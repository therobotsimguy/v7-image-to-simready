# USD + PhysX Schema Compatibility Skill

## When to Use
- Applying physics APIs to a USD prim and unsure what combinations are valid
- Debugging a silent physics failure (body doesn't move, joint ignored, collision missing)
- Choosing between ArticulationRootAPI vs independent rigid bodies
- Setting up kinematic vs dynamic bodies
- Understanding why something works in USD but breaks in PhysX at runtime

## The Compatibility Matrix

### API Combinations: What Works vs What Breaks

| API A | API B | Result | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| RigidBodyAPI | CollisionAPI (on child mesh) | **WORKS** | Standard pattern. Collision shapes on mesh descendants. |
| RigidBodyAPI | MassAPI | **WORKS** | MassAPI overrides auto-computed mass. Can apply on body or child meshes. |
| RigidBodyAPI | kinematicEnabled=true | **WORKS** | Body follows animated pose, pushes dynamic bodies with infinite mass. |
| RigidBodyAPI (parent) | RigidBodyAPI (child) | **CAUTION** | USD spec says nested rigid body creates independent subtree. **PhysX behavior differs**: child body is merged into parent in many cases. Reparent to siblings instead. |
| RigidBodyAPI (grandchild) | — | **BREAKS SILENTLY** | PhysX swallows grandchild rigid bodies. They become part of the nearest ancestor rigid body. F11 in failure-modes. |
| ArticulationRootAPI | kinematicEnabled=true | **BREAKS SILENTLY** | Articulation links CANNOT be kinematic (PhysX restriction). The body won't move. Use FixedJoint to world instead. |
| ArticulationRootAPI | RigidBodyAPI (same prim) | **WORKS** | Standard for floating-base articulation root. |
| ArticulationRootAPI | Flat sibling hierarchy | **WORKS** | Our pipeline pattern: body + parts as siblings under /root, ArticulationRootAPI on /root or body. |
| ArticulationRootAPI | Nested hierarchy | **CAUTION** | Works IF joints connect the tree correctly. But reparenting is safer for SimReady assets. |
| CollisionAPI | No RigidBodyAPI ancestor | **WORKS** | Static collider (world-fixed). No simulation owner needed. |
| CollisionAPI | Triangle mesh + dynamic RigidBody | **NEEDS SDF** | Triangle meshes on dynamic bodies require SDF collision. Without SDF, collision silently fails. |
| MeshCollisionAPI | approximation="none" | **STATIC ONLY** | Raw triangle mesh collision only works for static/kinematic. Dynamic bodies need convexHull, convexDecomposition, or SDF. |
| PhysicsMaterialAPI | material:binding (visual only) | **BREAKS SILENTLY** | PhysX ignores friction if only visual binding exists. MUST use `material:binding:physics` relationship. F30 in failure-modes. |
| PhysicsScene | Inside asset USD | **BAD PRACTICE** | Host app provides PhysicsScene. Asset-embedded scene conflicts with host. F33 in failure-modes. |
| DriveAPI | stiffness > 0 | **CAUTION** | Creates spring-return behavior. For free-moving doors/drawers, stiffness MUST be 0. F18 in failure-modes. |

### Kinematic vs Dynamic: Decision Matrix

| Property | Dynamic Body | Kinematic Body | Static Collider |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| RigidBodyAPI | Yes | Yes (kinematicEnabled=true) | No |
| Responds to forces/gravity | Yes | No (infinite mass) | No |
| Moves other dynamic bodies | Via collision | Pushes with infinite mass | Via collision |
| Collides with kinematic | Yes | **NO** (silent miss) | **NO** |
| Collides with static | Yes | **NO** (silent miss) | N/A |
| Can be in articulation | Yes | **NO** (silent fail) | No |
| Collision shape restriction | convexHull, convexDecomp, or SDF | Any | Any |
| Use case | Movable parts (doors, drawers) | Animated body, main_body | Walls, floors |

**Critical**: Kinematic-to-kinematic and kinematic-to-static collisions generate NO contact response. If your main_body is kinematic and a wall is static, they pass through each other.

### Collision Geometry Restrictions by Body Type

| Geometry Type | Static | Kinematic | Dynamic | Max Verts/Faces | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| convexHull | Yes | Yes | Yes | 255 | Fastest. Bloats concave shapes. |
| convexDecomposition | Yes | Yes | Yes | Per-hull 255 | Multiple convex hulls. Budget ~5 per asset. |
| triangle mesh (no SDF) | Yes | Yes | **NO** | Unlimited | Static/kinematic only without SDF. |
| triangle mesh + SDF | Yes | Yes | Yes | Unlimited | SDF required for dynamic. Heavy memory. |
| boundingBox / boundingSphere | Yes | Yes | Yes | N/A | Very rough approximation. |
| heightfield | **Static only** | No | No | Grid | Terrain only. |

**Negative scale is NOT supported for convex meshes** — will silently produce wrong collision shape.

## Articulation Rules

### When to Use ArticulationRootAPI

| Scenario | Use ArticulationRootAPI? | Why |
|----------|------------------------|-----|
| Robot arm (Franka, UR5) | **YES** | Reduced coordinates = zero joint error, better mass ratio handling |
| Cabinet with doors/drawers | **NO** (for SimReady) | Kinematic main_body is incompatible with articulations |
| Trolley with wheels (dynamic) | **MAYBE** | Works if ALL links are dynamic. But AssetBaseCfg can't use it. |
| Ragdoll / humanoid | **YES** | Tree of rigid bodies, no kinematic links |

### ArticulationRootAPI Restrictions (from PhysX 5.5)

1. **No kinematic links** — articulation links CANNOT be kinematic. Silent failure.
2. **No breakable joints** — articulation joints cannot break at runtime.
3. **No direct pose setting** — cannot `SetTranslate()` on individual links. Must set joint positions.
4. **No topology changes after scene insertion** — adding/removing links is silently blocked. Must remove articulation from scene, modify, re-add.
5. **Tree topology required** — no loops allowed natively. Loops require external rigid-body joints.
6. **No per-link sleep control** — entire articulation sleeps/wakes as unit.
7. **Spherical joints can drift** — locked axes on spherical joints may drift due to quaternion integration.

### Fixed-Base vs Floating

| Type | How to Set | Root Behavior | Use Case |
|------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Fixed-base** | `PxArticulationFlag::eFIX_BASE` | Anchored to world (perfect, no joint needed) | Robot arm on table |
| **Floating** | Default (no flag) | Root moves freely | Mobile robot, ragdoll |

**Fixed-base is superior to FixedJoint-to-world** because the immovable property is solved perfectly, not approximately.

## Joint Schema Details

### Joint Properties (all joint types inherit these)

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
|----------|------|---------|-------|
| body0 | relationship | — | First body (usually main_body) |
| body1 | relationship | — | Second body (movable part) |
| localPos0 | point3f | (0,0,0) | Joint anchor in body0's local space |
| localPos1 | point3f | (0,0,0) | Joint anchor in body1's local space |
| localRot0 | quatf | (1,0,0,0) | Joint frame orientation relative to body0 |
| localRot1 | quatf | (1,0,0,0) | Joint frame orientation relative to body1 |
| collisionEnabled | bool | false | Enable collision between jointed bodies |
| breakForce | float | inf | Force to break joint (inf = unbreakable) |
| excludeFromArticulation | bool | false | Use maximal coordinates instead of reduced |

**Both localPos at (0,0,0) = broken joint** — part pinned to origin. F14 in failure-modes.

### DriveAPI Formula

```
force = stiffness * (targetPosition - position) + damping * (targetVelocity - velocity)
```

| Parameter | SimReady Default | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| stiffness | **0** | MUST be 0 for free-moving parts. Non-zero = spring return (F18). |
| damping | 2.0 (revolute), 5.0 (prismatic) | Prevents free-fall oscillation |
| targetPosition | 0 | Rest position |
| targetVelocity | 0 | Rest velocity |
| maxForce | inf | Drive force limit |
| type | "force" | "force" or "acceleration" |

### LimitAPI Behavior

| low vs high | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| low < high | Normal range limit |
| low > high | DOF is **locked** |
| low = -inf, high = inf | No limit (free) |
| low = high | Locked at that position |

## PhysX Runtime Gotchas

### Silent Failures (things that break without error)

| # | What Happens | Why | Fix |
|---|-------------|-----|-----|
| 1 | Body doesn't move | kinematicEnabled on articulation link | Remove kinematicEnabled or don't use ArticulationRootAPI |
| 2 | Friction has no effect | Only visual material binding, no `material:binding:physics` | Create physics material binding relationship |
| 3 | Nested body merges into parent | RigidBodyAPI on child/grandchild prim | Reparent as sibling under /root |
| 4 | Dynamic mesh has no collision | Triangle mesh without SDF on dynamic body | Use convexHull, convexDecomposition, or add SDF |
| 5 | Kinematic passes through walls | Kinematic-to-static = no collision response | Use dynamic body if collision needed |
| 6 | Joint at world origin | Both localPos0 and localPos1 = (0,0,0) | Compute anchors with world_point_to_local() BEFORE reparent |
| 7 | contactOffset creates gripper gap | contactOffset baked in asset USD | Strip from asset, set at runtime only (0.00005) |
| 8 | Sleeping bodies ignore gravity change | PhysX doesn't auto-wake on gravity change | Call wakeUp() after changing gravity |
| 9 | Convex hull bloated | Negative scale on convex mesh | Ensure all scales are positive |
| 10 | Drive oscillates wildly | stiffness too high relative to timestep | Reduce stiffness or reduce timestep |
| 11 | Joint limit violated | Contact impulses override limit resolution | Increase solver iteration count |
| 12 | Friction degrades on complex shapes | >32 friction patches per contact manager | Simplify collision geometry |

### Solver Differences: PGS vs TGS

| Aspect | PGS (default CPU) | TGS (GPU default) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Friction processing | Final 3 position iterations only | Every iteration |
| Friction symmetry | Can be asymmetric | Symmetric |
| Mass ratio handling | Degrades above ~10:1 | Better (up to ~100:1) |
| Joint error | Accumulates | Lower accumulation |
| When to use | Simple scenes, CPU | Complex articulations, GPU |

## SimReady Asset Pattern (Recommended)

```
/root (DefaultPrim)
  /main_body    [RigidBodyAPI, kinematicEnabled=true, MassAPI, CollisionAPI on meshes]
  /door_left    [RigidBodyAPI, MassAPI, CollisionAPI on meshes]
  /door_right   [RigidBodyAPI, MassAPI, CollisionAPI on meshes]
  /drawer_01    [RigidBodyAPI, MassAPI, CollisionAPI on meshes]
  /wheel_FL     [RigidBodyAPI, MassAPI, CollisionAPI on meshes]
  /joints
    /joint_door_left   [RevoluteJoint, body0=/root/main_body, body1=/root/door_left]
    /joint_door_right  [RevoluteJoint, body0=/root/main_body, body1=/root/door_right]
    /joint_drawer_01   [PrismaticJoint, body0=/root/main_body, body1=/root/drawer_01]
    /joint_wheel_FL    [RevoluteJoint, body0=/root/main_body, body1=/root/wheel_FL]
  /Looks
    /DefaultMaterial   [PhysicsMaterialAPI, material:binding:physics on all meshes]
    /GripMaterial      [PhysicsMaterialAPI sf=1.0 df=0.9, bound to handles]
```

**Rules:**
- NO ArticulationRootAPI (main_body is kinematic = incompatible)
- NO PhysicsScene (host app provides it)
- NO contactOffset in USD (runtime only)
- NO RigidBodyAPI on grandchildren
- ALL movable parts as siblings of main_body (not children)
- ALL collision meshes bound via `material:binding:physics`
- ALL joints connect to main_body as body0
- Use `--dynamic` flag for trolleys (removes kinematicEnabled, adds damping)

## Real-World Issues from GitHub (PhysX + Newton)

| [PhysX#286](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX/issues/286) | D6 Joint doesn't report drive force | Force reporting missing for certain joint configurations | Use articulation joints instead of D6 joints for force feedback |

### PhysX Collision / SDF Issues

| Issue | Problem | Root Cause | Workaround |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| [PhysX#383](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX/issues/383) | Access violation crash when triangle mesh is very small (mm scale) | SDF computation fails on sub-millimeter geometry | Use convexHull/convexDecomposition for small meshes; ensure units are meters not mm |
| [PhysX#247](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX/issues/247) | SDF + kinematic toggle causes CUDA error and driver crash | Switching rigid body to kinematic while SDF collision is active corrupts GPU state | Don't toggle kinematic on bodies with SDF collision at runtime |

### Newton (Isaac Sim Next-Gen) Issues

| Issue | Problem | Root Cause | Workaround |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| [Newton#980](https://github.com/newton-physics/newton/issues/980) | USD Franka from MuJoCo fails to load: "inertia must have positive values" | URDF→USD conversion produces zero/negative inertia on some links | Ensure all links have valid positive inertia tensors after conversion |

### Key Takeaways from GitHub Issues

1. **TGS solver is faster but less stable** — PhysX#164, #407, #467 all involve TGS instability. PGS is safer for complex scenes.
2. **SDF collision is fragile** — crashes on small meshes (#383), corrupts GPU on kinematic toggle (#247), corrupts CUDA context (Newton#1616). Use convexHull/convexDecomposition as default; only use SDF when needed.
3. **Drive mode matters** — `TARGET` mode is deprecated and silently broken (#161). Always use `FORCE` mode.
4. **Quaternion precision** — Float32 quaternion math can silently corrupt joint angles in specific topologies (#204). No fix — it's a known limitation.
5. **Don't toggle kinematic at runtime** on bodies with SDF or complex collision (#247). Set once and leave it.
6. **URDF/USD conversion drops properties** — inertia (#980), gravity direction (#1293), joint limits (#973). Always validate after conversion.
